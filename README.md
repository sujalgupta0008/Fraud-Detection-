# 📝Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can proactively detect fraudulent financial transactions. The dataset represents a simulated mobile money transaction system over 30 days. The goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent and to derive actionable business insights that can help reduce fraud risk.

To develop a data-driven system that identifies potentially fraudulent financial transactions by analyzing patterns, anomalies, and risk indicators in transaction data, enabling early fraud detection and supporting better decision-making in financial security.

🎯 Project Objectives:

- Clean and preprocess raw financial transaction data for reliable analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify fraud patterns and trends
- Build a machine learning model to classify potentially fraudulent transactions
- Detect anomalies and high-risk behavior using predictive analytics
- Visualize fraud insights, KPIs, and risk trends using an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Analyze key features influencing fraudulent activities
- Simulate a real-world fraud monitoring and decision-support system
